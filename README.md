# Online Railway Ticket Reservation System

This is a Mini Project done during my 3rd Semester.
Online railway ticket reservation system developed in Java with SQL connectivity. The system allows users to search for trains, view seat availability, book tickets, and manage reservations.

## Features

- **Train Search**: Users can search for trains based on the source and destination stations, date, and other criteria. The system provides a list of available trains along with their departure and arrival times.

- **Seat Availability**: Users can check seat availability for a specific train on a given date. The system displays the number of available seats in each class.

- **Ticket Booking**: Users can select the desired train and class, enter passenger details, and book tickets. The system generates a unique booking reference number and confirms the booking.

- **Reservation Management**: Users can view and manage their reservations. They can cancel bookings, view booking details, and check the status of their reservations.

- **User Authentication**: The system provides user authentication to ensure secure access to the reservation functionality.

- **Admin Module**: User cannot access Admin Module, Admin can view all the user activity and Manage Train Details.
